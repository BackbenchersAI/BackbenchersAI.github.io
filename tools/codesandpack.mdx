# Power Your MDX with Sandpack: Interactive Code Playgrounds in Documentation

*Transform your static documentation into interactive learning experiences with embedded code playgrounds*

## Introduction

Documentation has evolved far beyond static text and code snippets. Modern developers expect interactive experiences where they can experiment with code directly in the browser. **Sandpack**, CodeSandbox's component toolkit, combined with **remark-sandpack**, brings this interactivity directly to your MDX documents.

This comprehensive guide explores how to integrate Sandpack with MDX to create engaging, interactive documentation that allows readers to run, modify, and experiment with code examples in real-time.

## What is Sandpack?

Sandpack is CodeSandbox's toolkit for creating live-running code editing experiences. It provides:

### Core Features

üèÉ **Live Code Execution**: Run JavaScript, React, Vue, and other frameworks directly in the browser
üì¶ **NPM Package Support**: Install and use any NPM package in your examples
üé® **Customizable Themes**: Match your brand with custom styling
üì± **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all devices
‚ö° **Fast Loading**: Optimized bundling and caching for quick startup times
üîß **Multiple Templates**: Support for React, Vue, Angular, Vanilla JS, and more

### Why Sandpack + MDX?

The combination of Sandpack and MDX creates powerful documentation experiences:
